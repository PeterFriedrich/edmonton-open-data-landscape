# DATA_ISSUES — defects in data we do not control, and what we've told the publisher

**What belongs here:** a defect in a source we consume — plus the evidence, what
it breaks on our side, and **whether anyone has been told**. One row per defect,
newest first.

**What does NOT belong here:**

| this file | where it goes instead |
|---|---|
| how a source is shaped, its columns, its quirks | `data/DATA.md` |
| our own build work and backlog | `TODO.md` |
| a locked decision + its reasoning | `docs/DECISIONS.md` |
| an audit we ran over our own pipeline | `docs/AUDIT_LEDGER.md` |

⚠️ **The point of the file is the last column.** Findings that never leave the
repo are the standing failure mode: a measured upstream defect can be archived
unsent as a sub-item of a closed parent and go invisible. Status must be one of
**NOT SENT · SENT (date) · ACKNOWLEDGED (date) · FIXED (date) · WONTFIX**, and
"the artifact exists" is **not** sent.
