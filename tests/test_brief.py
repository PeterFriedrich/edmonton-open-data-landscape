"""Guards on the Claude web brief (`scripts/make_brief.py`, `docs/CLAUDE_WEB.md`).

The committed `docs/BRIEF.md` is what a claude.ai Project syncs. It is only
worth syncing if it matches the repo, so the first test fails the merge gate
when it is stale. The rest pin what the generator keeps and drops, each against
a fixture repo, so a parser that quietly stops matching fails here instead of
producing a brief with an empty section.
